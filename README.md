This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify SMS messages into predefined categories, including spam, fraud, transaction alerts, and logistics. The pipeline covers the end-to-end process from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model training, evaluation, and deployment. It leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization, combined with machine learning algorithms for accurate message classification. The project demonstrates the practical application of data-driven techniques to automate message categorization and can be extended for real-world use cases such as SMS filtering and alert systems
